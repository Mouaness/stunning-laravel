Sudo is used to run a command as a superuser or administrator, 
allowing you to perform tasks that require elevated permissions.
For example, you might use the "sudo" command to install software, configure the system, or access files that are protected.

apt-get is used to manage packages, including installation, upgrading, and removal of packages.
The "apt-get" command works by using a database of packages that are available from repositories specified in the system's software sources.
